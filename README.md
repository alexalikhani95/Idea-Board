// TODO: Change this - look at any of my repos

- what is this project?
- what scripts do I need?
- Developer notes / COMMENTS.md
- Deployed in both README and Github repo

// Package.json

- move the dependencies to dev dependencies e.g. testing ones
- if you don't understand, research YT / google
- fix linting script

// Generally

- remove code your not using e.g. webvitals
- try and extend the default ESLINT config
- look into eslint + prettier clashes <- GOogle this eslint/prettier package the prettier has to go at the end of the "extends"/"plugins"
- https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html
- https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/
- https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/common-beginner-mistakes/
- look into jest ESLINT config
- Triple check all the requirements

// Next Project Wise

- send me subjects/hobbies/functionality
- planes, cars, bands, movies
- push notifications, auth, serverless, react-native vs PWA, emails, data viz
- zustand, recoilJS, mobx
- tailwind vs styled components
- NEXTJS or Remix but probably NextJS! Single biggest thing to learn
- Server Components

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
